    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Who Am I?</h3>
    <p>Other than being a computer science/finance major(the boring resume stuff), I am a funny, hip-hop loving, sports
      loving, caring, sometimes nerdy, sometimes goofy individual that was born and raised in New Jersey. If you explore this website you can see some cool
      data that I have collected about myself.

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Whats my Goal?</h3>
    <p>
      My goal in life is to be able to help all those who may not have the luxuries I have whether I end up as
      a billionaire or just live a modest life.
      Growing up I had the luxury of being exposed to a lot of diverse individuals and it made me realize that I was very 
      fortunate to have what I had.
      Some people had it much worse than me. Some families lived pay check to pay check.
      It made me realize the importance of appreciating what I have in life and doing my job to try and help people that I
      share this world with. </p>

      <p>Jermaine Cole reached A+ celebrity status when he dropped the song "No Role Models", which took the world by
        storm.
        He talks about how growing up he had no one to look up to.
        Luckily for me there are some people who have had an influence on who I am today.</p>
